### Briefly About Myself
Several years ago I moved to Canada and had to start working in the production area. However, before moving, I used to learn front-end development in Ukraine and I remember that I really liked that. My main goal is changing my career and finding something more profitable, interesting and creative than I am doing now.
Furthermore, I like the possibility of finding remote work in this area in the future.
I am ambitious and a challenge acceptable that I believe will help me to learn and gain new skills very fast and become a proficient Front-End Developer.


### SKILLS:
HTML5, CSS3
JavaScript Basics
Git, GitHub
Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Corel Draw


### Code Example
I have done challenges through the FrontEnd Mentor
This is part of my code to create calculator.
Here you can see the full solution calculator_app

```
    document.getElementById('result').onclick = function () {getResult()};
    function getResult() {
      if (equation === result.toString()) {
        cleanUp();
      } else if (equation.match(new RegExp(/\+/g)) ) {
          result = parseFloat(firstNum) + parseFloat(shownNum);
      showResult();
        } else if (equation.match(new RegExp(/\-/g))) {
          result = parseFloat(firstNum) - parseFloat(shownNum);
          showResult();
        } else if (equation.match(new RegExp(/\*/g))) {
          result = parseFloat(firstNum) * parseFloat(shownNum);
          showResult();
        } else if (equation.match(new RegExp(/\%/g))) {
          result = parseFloat(firstNum) / parseFloat(shownNum);
          showResult();
        }
        return result
    }
```
